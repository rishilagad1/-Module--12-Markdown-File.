I describe how to build a new R Markdown file in this blog post.

Launch R studio and make a new R Markdown file as the first step.


Step 2: Choose "new file" from the file menu. Markdown R

Step 3: Give it a title (I chose "R markdown").

Step 4: Save the file with HTML set as the default output. After saving the file.

Step 5: Click the "Knit" button in the top left corner and choose "knit to HTML." You will then be prompted to save the file in the html.Rmd format. File saving.

- We can enter tables, R code chunks, photos, etc. in this R markdown file.

We can introduce R code chunks, for instance, by using the code:
---
title: "R Markdown"
author: "Rishi Lagad"
date: "2023-04-03"
output: html_document
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
Conclusion:

I learned that R markdown is a strong tool for creating dynamic documents in html, pdf, and word formats by incorporating code chunks, tables, and graphics.
